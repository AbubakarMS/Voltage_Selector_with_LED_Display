# Voltage Selector with LED Display

This project implements a voltage selector system using an ATmega328 microcontroller, P10 LED display, and nine push buttons with resistors. The system allows the user to choose from nine different voltage levels and displays the selected voltage on the LED display.

## Features

- Nine push buttons for voltage selection
- Analog-to-digital conversion for voltage measurement
- P10 LED display for visual representation of the selected voltage
- User-friendly interface for easy voltage selection

## Hardware Requirements

- ATmega328 microcontroller
- P10 LED display module
- Nine push buttons
- Nine resistors for voltage selection
- Breadboard or PCB for circuit assembly
- Jumper wires for interconnections
- Power supply for the microcontroller and LED display

## Circuit Diagram

Please refer to the schematic diagram for the circuit connections and component placements. Ensure proper connections and follow standard practices for circuit assembly.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the ATmega328 microcontroller, P10 LED display, push buttons, and resistors according to the circuit diagram.
3. Ensure the necessary power supply is provided to the microcontroller and LED display.
4. Upload the provided source code to the ATmega328 microcontroller using an appropriate programmer or IDE.
5. Verify that all connections are secure and properly made.
6. Power on the system and start using the voltage selector with LED display.

## Usage

1. Press any of the nine push buttons to select a voltage level.
2. The microcontroller will measure the voltage using analog-to-digital conversion and determine the selected voltage.
3. The selected voltage will display the Appropriate text on the P10 LED display.
4. To change the voltage selection, press a different push button.
5. The LED display will update accordingly to show the newly selected voltage.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all connections are correctly made according to the circuit diagram.
- Check the power supply to the microcontroller and LED display.
- Verify that the source code is properly uploaded to the microcontroller.
- If the LED display is not showing any output, double-check the data input and control signals.
